# ReferenceET
Codes to help compute reference ET

### ReferenceET_for_USA.ipynb:

This is a Google Colab Notebook for computing hourly ASCE reference ET. Since the parameters used were tested specifically for US states, please use this code only if the location is within the US. It has been spot checked at a few spots in the Western US using USBR Agrimet sites.


### Agrimet_Extraction.ipynb:

This is a Google Colab Notebook for extracting hourly weather data from USBR. This can then be used to compute hourly Reference ET.
